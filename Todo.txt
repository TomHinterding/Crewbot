Ticked off: functions to get the api data, format it and save aswell as update the data to files

Todo:
-discord frontend:
    Controlable:
    -What Clan/Clans (in progress) Clan hinzufügen funkt, clan entfernen noch einfügen
    -What players should be tracked and what accounts do they own (fast) autocomplete muss noch rin da

-backend:
-fetching the data for those clans and players
-formatting it for the excel sheets (is it possible to know if a player was set to red when the war started?)
-connecting it to an online excel sheet:
-displaying that data

Questions to solve:
How do I update the data to be accurate and hopefull not muss last minute attacks(Usually clanwar search takes 1-2 minutes to start again at least)
